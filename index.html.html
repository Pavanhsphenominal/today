He rose through the ranks, gaining experience and honing his leadership skills. In 2001, he became the Chief Minister of Gujarat, a position he held for three consecutive terms until he assumed the role of Prime Minister in 2014.
Transformative Reforms and Economic Development<br>Modi's tenure as Prime Minister has been marked by a series of transformative reforms aimed at driving economic growth and development. One of his key initiatives was the introduction of the Goods and Services Tax (GST), a comprehensive indirect tax system that simplified the taxation structure and enhanced ease of doing business in India. Additionally, he launched the "Make in India" campaign to encourage domestic and foreign investment, promoting manufacturing and job creation.

He has actively engaged with world leaders and strengthened India's position on the global stage. His diplomatic initiatives, such as the "Neighborhood First" policy, aimed at strengthening ties with neighboring countries, and the "Act East" policy, focused on strengthening relations with Southeast Asian nations, have contributed to India's growing influence in the international arena.

The "Swachh Bharat Abhiyan" (Clean India Campaign) aimed to improve sanitation and cleanliness across the country.
